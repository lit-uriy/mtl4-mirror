Problems and questions with numerical concepts

- is_invertible with templated type
- how to express convertibility of results (needed for templated concept map of complex)
- how to express consistency between * and *= and so on
- if different result_type are defined in a concept C which one is C::result_type ?
- mutually convertible result of Addable<T> and Magma< add<T>, T > 
- concept maps of char and short
- Can we express Prime<N> as a concept?

- namespaces in concepts vs. template functions 
  when using NS::f in template function, how to express the concept that
  f is searched in NS unless ADL says otherwise


- Can we check types for classes, e.g. is integral









Long-term problems

- Algebraic structures as equivalence classes instead of one type
