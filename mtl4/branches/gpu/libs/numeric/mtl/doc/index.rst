Welcome to the Boost project to rewrite the `Matrix Template
Library`_.  

Resources
  - The official `Statement Of Work`_.

  - The `Development Plan`_ and current status report.  This
    document will be updated with news and details as development
    proceeds.  At the moment, it is the route to this project's 
    `documentation`_.

  - Documentation for Jeremy Siek's `early prototype`_.  We will be
    basing much of our work on this.  Although excellent work and
    very worthwhile reading, it is not fully polished and it does
    contain some errors.
