Welcome to the Boost project to rewrite the `Matrix Template
Library`_.  

Resources
  - The official `Statement Of Work`_.

  - The `Development Plan`_ and current status report.  This
    document will be updated with news and details as development
    proceeds.

  - Jeremy Siek's `preliminary documentation`_ for his early prototype
    of this project.  We will be basing much of our work on this.
    Although excellent work and very worthwhile reading, it is not
    fully polished and it does contain some errors.
