Boost MTL Project

To make Boost.Build work in this project, create a file
called "boost-build.jam" in this directory, containing:

  boost-build path/to/boost/tools/build/v2 ;

Where path/to/boost/tools/build/v2 is the path to the tools/build/v2
subdirectory of a standard Boost CVS image.  Whitespace is
significant, so preserve the space before the ';'.

Then issue the command

   bjam
