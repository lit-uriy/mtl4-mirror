Scons Build System README:

1) BLAS support
 The BLAS support in the build system scans automatically for well know
 BLAS libraries. The behavior can be changed with the following command
 line parameters:

  blas_path - manually add a search path for BLAS libraries
  blas_lib - search specifically for this library (lib<libname>) 
  blas_ldflags - set LDFLAGS for BLAS manually (useful if a BLAS library
   is used that is unknown to the build system)
